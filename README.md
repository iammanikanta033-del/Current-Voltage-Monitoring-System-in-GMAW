# Current-Voltage-Monitoring-System-in-GMAW
Real-time voltage and current monitoring system for GMAW using Hall Effect sensors, INA117 amplifier, NI DAQ, and LabVIEW.

This project presents the development of a real-time electrical monitoring system for Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) used in Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM). The system measures and records voltage and current during the deposition process to analyze arc stability and energy input characteristics.

The setup integrates Hall Effect sensors (LA305-S) for current measurement and an INA117 differential amplifier for voltage sensing. These signals are fed into an NI USB-6001 Data Acquisition (DAQ) device and visualized using LabVIEW, enabling accurate, real-time monitoring of welding parameters.
